Basic solver for puzzles where you have 7 cylinders with either number of operators
and you have to align all to get valid equations.

How to build and run
====================

    ./gradlew jar
    java -cp build/libs/cylinderSolver*.jar org.example.Main

Room for improvement
====================

- It's probably pointless to rotate every cylinder: we could probably let the first one
  without rotation (otherwise we probably get 4 times all solutions). That could divide
  by 4 the execution time
