This repo has moved to https://codeberg.org/gturri/cylinderSolver

------------------------------

Basic solver for puzzles where you have 7 cylinders with either number of operators
and you have to align all to get valid equations.

How to build and run
====================

    ./gradlew jar
    java -cp build/libs/cylinderSolver*.jar org.example.Main

Room for improvement
====================
- we're exploring 2 times more positions than needed because if "c_1 c_2 ... c_n-1 = c_n" is a valid solution
  then it's pointless to find hat "c_n = c_1 c2 ... c_n-1" is also a solution
